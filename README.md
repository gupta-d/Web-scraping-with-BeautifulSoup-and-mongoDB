# Web-scraping-with-BeautifulSoup-and-mongoDB

This repository contains code for web scraping for Mars related news from a few website, and display on an html page.
I have used 'splinter' with chromedriver and BeautifulSoup for scraping the data. The data (news, images, weather conditions etc) are saved in a mongoDB database.

A flask application is built to render the data to an html page. 

Repository contains a Jupyter notebook with Web scraping code, a flask app file in python and corresponding html file.
